CoC-Alpha
=========

Bleeding-edge Corruption-of-Champions release.

These files are automatically built by the CoC-Build-Bot, and uploaded autonomously.  

There are two proper files in this repository:  
- `CoC-0.{Version No}-A-{random chars}.swf` is the game for PCs  
- `CoC-0.{Version No}-A-{random chars}.apk` is the game for Android Phones  

Click the version you want (*probably* the `.swf` version), and then the "view raw" link to download the game.

Any changes to the main Corruption-of-Champions repository will trigger a rebuild, so unless the commit to the repo broke something, this should always be the latest-possible version.
